**Rocket Man: A Celebration of Elton John's Iconic Performance**

"Rocket Man" by Jenna Louise is a vibrant homage to the legendary Sir Elton John, capturing his iconic 1975 Dodgers Stadium performance. Conceived with the LGBTQIA+ community in mind, this painting celebrates Elton John’s charisma, flair, and enduring status as an icon. Inspired by a conversation with my best friend, this piece was created to resonate joyously for a Pride festival.

The painting measures 40 inches by 30 inches and is an acrylic masterpiece on a gallery-wrapped canvas, stretched over 2-inch stretcher bars. The dazzling atmosphere of the concert is meticulously recreated using reference photos. Colors inspired by the Dodgers baseball team and textures mimicking Elton John's sequined outfits bring the scene to life.

Capturing Elton John’s facial expression as he looks over his right shoulder, mouth open in a high note, was particularly challenging but serves as the focal point of the piece. This detail draws viewers into the electric energy of his performance.

"Rocket Man" is designed to transport viewers back to that incredible night in 1975, making them feel as if they are among the crowd, witnessing Elton John’s powerful vocals and stage presence. It's perfect for fans of Elton John, classic rock enthusiasts, and anyone looking to own a piece of pop culture history.
