**Need A Buzz: Consumed by Media**

"Need A Buzz" by Jenna Louise is a thought-provoking painting that examines the pervasive influence of media on our identity. This striking piece features a girl with a TV for a head, its static blending seamlessly into her skin, symbolizing how media consumption can transform us into what we consume. Jenna's 15x30-inch acrylic on gallery-wrapped canvas uses a pastel palette to juxtapose the unsettling message, creating a visually compelling narrative about the dangers of losing oneself to media saturation.

The symbolism in "Need A Buzz" is palpable. The static from the TV, which merges with the girl's skin, represents the insidious nature of constant media exposure. The grey skin tone contrasts sharply with her vibrant clothing, highlighting the loss of individuality and the blurring of reality and media perception. Jenna's choice of pastel pinks and purples creates a stark contrast to the greyscale figure, drawing attention to the vibrancy of life that gets overshadowed by media consumption. The pink background further emphasizes the unsettling nature of the TV-headed figure, evoking a sense of disconnection and artificiality.
