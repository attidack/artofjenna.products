### My Process

Creating art is more than just the final piece; it’s about the journey, the emotion, and the stories that bring it to life. Here’s an inside look into my artistic process, the techniques I use, and the variety of prints I offer.

**What inspires your artwork?**
My inspiration stems from personal experiences and my understanding of human behavior. With a background in psychology, I paint the world through my unique lens, channeling my emotions and reflections into each piece.

**Can you describe your artistic process from concept to completion?**
I begin with a general composition sketch on my iPad, eager to start painting. Using a projector, I transfer the sketch onto a canvas and create a wash before sketching the drawing onto it. I prefer using smaller paintbrushes to preserve detail, relying heavily on a color wheel and photo references. Music, especially Billy Eilish’s latest album, keeps me in the zone. Sometimes, I repaint sections until I’m satisfied with the composition.

**How do you decide on the themes and subjects of your paintings?**
Themes and subjects often emerge from my personal life and recommendations from friends and colleagues. Each piece reflects a part of my journey and emotional state.

**What techniques do you use in your paintings?**
I utilize brushwork, layering, and color blending. The versatility of acrylics allows me to experiment and express freely.



**How long does it typically take you to complete a painting?**
The time varies greatly. Commission pieces follow a set timeline, while personal originals can remain idle for months, awaiting inspiration. I often have multiple pieces in progress, working on whichever one inspiration draws me to. Deciding when a piece is finished is challenging—sometimes, the painting itself tells me it’s done.

**How would you describe your artistic style?**
My primary focus is portraiture, emphasizing realism. Over time, I’ve worked to loosen up in my artwork, aiming to create conversational pieces that challenge the mind and evoke emotion. While maintaining these focuses, I experiment with more ethereal and mixed media art.

**What do you hope viewers take away from your art?**
I love that my work sparks conversation. Whether people love it or hate it, my art evokes strong emotions—anger, sadness, happiness, empowerment—and challenges us to break through our barriers.

Each piece of my art, whether an original or a high-quality print, is a labor of love and a fragment of my journey. I invite you to explore my work, connect with the emotions within, and perhaps find a piece that resonates with your own experiences. Start with our Luster Prints and explore the range of options to find the perfect piece for your collection.

**What is a Luster Print, and how does it differ from other types of prints?**

Luster Prints offer a professional look with rich, deep colors and subtle texture. Combining the vibrant color of gloss prints with the fingerprint resistance and glare reduction of matte prints, they provide a perfect balance. These prints are locally produced in Salt Lake City, ensuring top quality. Consider upgrading to Archival Fine Art Prints for enhanced texture and longevity.

**What are 100% cotton rag archival prints on watercolor paper?**

These prints are created on cold-pressed, 100% cotton rag watercolor paper, providing a textured, high-quality reproduction of the original artwork. The cold-press technique allows for better ink absorption and richer color representation. Designed to last, these prints preserve the artwork’s integrity over time, also produced locally in Salt Lake City.  To truly experience the artwork, consider owning the original piece.


**What is a Giclee canvas print, and what makes it special?**

Giclee canvas prints are high-resolution reproductions that capture the original painting’s texture and detail. Stretched on 2-inch stretcher bars, they offer a gallery-quality finish. The giclee printing process uses archival inks for long-lasting color fidelity and durability. Each print is locally produced in Salt Lake City, ensuring exceptional quality.
