**A Meditation on Life and Mortality**

"Bloom and Decay" is a captivating piece that delves into the profound themes of existence and impermanence. Created in 2018, this 30x24-inch acrylic painting on gallery-wrapped canvas captures the delicate balance between life’s fleeting beauty and the inevitability of decay. At the center, a skull symbolizes mortality, surrounded by lush, blooming flowers that represent vitality and growth. The stark contrast between the decaying skull and the vibrant blossoms creates a powerful visual metaphor for the cycle of life and death.

Jenna’s masterful use of color brings a poignant depth to the piece. The rich greens and vivid pinks of the flowers burst forth from the dark background, emphasizing their fleeting beauty against the muted, earthy tones of the skull. This interplay of light and dark not only enhances the dramatic impact of the painting but also invites the viewer to reflect on the ephemeral nature of beauty and the inevitable passage of time.
